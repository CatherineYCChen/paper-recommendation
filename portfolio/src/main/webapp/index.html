    <p>Hi! My name is Catherine Yu-Chi Chen. I am currently a junior at 
          <a href= "https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University of New York.</a></p>
      <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Fun Fact: Columbia's school colour, Patone 290, 
          is one of my favourite colours as well. (btw, this colour is not Pantone 290 lol)</p>
      
      <p>I was born in Taipei, Taiwan in 2000. Along with my mother, and sister, I immigrated to 
          Toronto, Canada in 2010, while my father stayed in Taiwan to work and support our family.</p>
      <p>I studied in Canada from grade 5 to 12, and I attended high school at 
          <a href= "https://earlhaig.ca/main.php">Earl Haig Secondary School</a>, where I was part of the 
          <a href="https://earlhaig.ca/departments/claude/site/index.php">Claude Watson Arts Program</a>
           as a music major specializing in the cello.</p>

      <h4>Swimming</h4>
      <p>I have been swimming since I was in kindergarden, and I was on the swim team in high school. </p>
    
      <h4>Dogs</h4>
      <p>I have two dogs: Minnie the Mini Pinscher, and LuLu the Doberman. Unfortunately, 
          Minnie passed away last spring.</p>

      <p>I began my musical journey by playing piano in kindergarden.</p> 
      <img src="images/Chen_Catherine.jpg" width="200" height="225"/>
      <p>Afterwards, my elementary school required that the students participate in some sort of 
          extra-curriculum activity, and I experimented with many things. Ultimately, I began playing 
          the cello seriously when I was 10 years old and continued until I was a sophomore in high school.
           During my junior and senior years of high school, I focused more on chamber and orchestral music, 
           as well as composition</p>

    <p>I enjoy an array of mediums for visual arts, from sketching, to painting, calligraphy, sewing,

<!-- Data Science Section -->

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Data Science</h3>
        <p>In my senior year of high school, I took a course called Data Management, which included
            topics that covered probability theory, and basic regressions/analysis. For my cumulative 
            project in that class, I conducted research on the relationship between a country's
            GDP per capita, and cereal consumption per capita - which I was interested in after 
            reading the book 'Guns, Germs, and Steel'. As the book outlines, there appears to be a
            positive correlation between the two variables:
        </p>
            <div id="chart-container1"></div>

        <p>Upon taking this course, I became enticed by the field of data science. However, I was still new 
            to the area, and so during my first and second year of college, I experimented with
            different subjects - math, chemistry, computer science, etc. However, my passion for data persisted
            and I ultimately declared Data Science as my major this spring. Data Science
            is a special joint-major that is offered by the statistics 
            and computer science department at Columbia 
            that was created in response to the growing significance of "big data".

              works towards transforming Taiwan's technology industry. At ITRI, I worked in the 
              biomaterials lab, where I assisted in conducting experiments for biomaterial development,
              and conducted research on the innovation of various biomaterials.</dd>

          <dd>Point Robotics is a relatively new company that develops surgical robots relying on
              computer vision, machine learning, and AI, to perform spinal surgeries. At Point Robotics,
              I developed a program for 3D image reconstruction, GUI development for the program, and 
              implemented the program to perform 3D printing of the reconstructed models. In addition,
              I conducted research on various computer vision techniques in order to improve image reconstruction,
              as well as other recognition technologies required for the surgical robots.
