      <h1>Catherine's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>Hi! My name is Catherine Yu-Chi Chen. I am currently a junior studying Data Science at <a href= "https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University of New York.</a></p>
      <p>Data Science is a special joint-major that is offered by the statistics and computer science department at Columbia,
          that was created in response to the growing significance of "big data".
      </p>
      <<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">>Coincidentally, Columbia's school colour, Patone 290, is my favourite colour as well.</p>
