      <h1>Catherine's Portfolio</h1>
      <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Catherine Yu-Chi Chen. I am currently a junior at 
          <a href= "https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University of New York.</a></p>

      <p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Fun Fact: Columbia's school colour, Patone 290, 
          is one of my favourite colours as well. (btw, this colour is not Pantone 290 lol)</p>
      
      <h2>About Me: Background</h2>
      <p>I was born in Taipei, Taiwan in 2000. Along with my mother, and sister, I immigrated to 
          Toronto, Canada in 2010, while my father stayed in Taiwan to work and support our family.</p>
      <p>I studied in Canada from grade 5 to 12, and I attended high school at 
          <a href= "https://earlhaig.ca/main.php">Earl Haig Secondary School</a>, where I was part of the 
          <a href="https://earlhaig.ca/departments/claude/site/index.php">Claude Watson Arts Program</a>
          , as a music major, specifically for the cello.</p>
      
      <h3>My Music Experience</h3>
      <p>I began my musical journey by playing piano in kindergarden.</p> 
      <img src="images/Chen_Catherine.jpg" width="200" height="225"/>
      <p>Afterwards, my elementary school required that the students participate in some sort of 
          extra-curriculum activity, and I experimented with many things. Ultimately, I began playing 
          the cello seriously when I was 10 years old and continued until I was a sophomore in high school.
           During my junior and senior years of high school, I focused more on chamber and orchestral music, 
           as well as composition</p>

      <h3>Other Hobbies</h3>
      <h4>Visual Art</h4>
      <img src="images/IMG_0074.JPG" width="500" height="300"/>
      <p>I enjoy an array of mediums for visual arts, from sketching, to painting, calligraphy, sewing, 
          woodwork, sculpting, and photoshop.</p>
      <p>I have never undergone professional training in art, but I like doing art in my spare time.</p>

      <h2>About Me: Where Am I Now? Data Science</h2>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, I am a junior at Columbia University. I am currently majoring in Data Science, which
          is a special joint-major that is offered by the statistics 
          and computer science department at Columbia,
          that was created in response to the growing significance of "big data".
